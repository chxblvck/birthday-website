    <h2>Hi love,</h2>
    <p>
      I don’t know how to start this without smiling.<br><br>
      Even without meeting yet, you’ve found a way to be close to me —
      through your words, your presence, and the way you care.<br><br>
      You make my days lighter, my thoughts softer,
      and my heart calmer.<br><br>
      This isn’t just a birthday message.
      It’s a reminder that you matter to me more than you know.<br><br>
      Happy birthday. I’m so glad you exist.
